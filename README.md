## 👋 Hello! I'm Anderson Luiz

I hold a degree in **Internet Systems** from **UNCISAL (Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas)**, completed in **2020**.
I have been working professionally in software development since **2021**, gaining experience across multiple stacks and development environments.

My career began as a **backend developer** using **Python (Django)** at **Taibu Tecnologia**, where I strengthened my understanding of architecture and RESTful APIs.
I then transitioned into **mobile development with Flutter**, which broadened my perspective on user experience and cross-platform solutions.

In **2022**, I joined **Acheplus**, working with **ReactJS** and **Node.js (Express)** to build modern web applications.
Later that year, I worked at **Gespag**, again focusing on **Flutter**, deepening my expertise in mobile development.
I returned to **Acheplus** in **2023**, where I continue to work today, using a stack that includes **NestJS (Node)**, **Flutter**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **Vue.js**.

I’m passionate about technology, clean code practices, and continuous learning.
My goal is to create efficient, scalable solutions with a strong focus on user experience and maintainability.
